2007-12-08	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* Makefile.am: merged shared/vme/vme_universe.c and
	shared/vme/vme_universe_dma.c into one file.

2007-12-08	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* vme/VMEConfig.h: added error status to
	BSP_VME_UNIVERSE_INSTALL_IRQ_MGR(err) macro.

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* startup/bspstart: removed _Cpu_table.exceptions_in_RAM.

2007/10/08 (TS):
 - (bspstart.c) resize IBAT0 (and while we're at it DBAT0, too even though
   the latter is disabled once page tables are up) to ONLY cover
   physical memory size.
   This resolves mysterious exceptions which seem to be caused by
   branch prediction into mapped but non-existent memory!
 - (yellowfin.c) yellowfin TX descriptor ring was clobbered when completely full
   because space for the STOP command entry was unaccounted for.
   Fixed by initializing tx_free to ring size - 1.
 - (yellowfin.c) increased yellowfin_max_interrupt_work to sum of ring sizes
   to get rid of 'too much work for daemon' messages.
 - (Makefile.am) MUST NOT use -msoft-float because this also prevents CR7
   to be set/cleared when calling vararg routines (which may then save/restore
   FP args on the stack or do other bad things) :-(
   Still don't know how to deal with implicit usage of the FPU by GCC
   (problem in ISRs and integer-only tasks).
 - (detect_grackle_bridge.c) report original ERRDR1/EDDDR2 contents rather
   than values read back after clearing these registers (affects only
   printk message; routine's return value was always OK).

ChangeLog: New file.
